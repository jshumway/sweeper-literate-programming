;; Before moving on to bomb placements, we're going to build a helpful utility
;; function that allows us to easily iterate through every cell in the grid.

;;
;; (for [y row (ipairs grid)]
;;    (for [x cell (ipairs row)]
;;       ... do something with x, y, and cell...))

;;
;; Not only is it cleaner, but it is decoupled from the implementation details
;; of grid. Now the user of `icells` doesn't need to know that grid is a column-
;; major 2d array.
;;
;; In another language like Java we'd need to "unpack" the iteration, maintaining
;; the state needed to "resume" iteration each time the iterator is asked for
;; the next element. Luckily Lua provides coroutines, allowing us to write code
;; just like above, just needing some extra book keeping. See the appendix for
;; a non-coroutine alternative version.

;; TODO honestly just link to and quote the docs:
;; "Actually, coroutines provide a powerful tool for this task. Again, the key
;; feature is their ability to turn upside-down the relationship between caller
;; and callee. With this feature, we can write iterators without worrying about

;; Before we get to drawing the board we need one more piece of game state.
;; Countdown Mode is an alternative display mode. You can think if it this way:
;; instead of displaying in uncovered cells the number of adjacent bombs, you
;; display the number of adjacent bombs that have not yet been flagged. The
;; thinking goes that, if the player has accounted for an adjacent bomb by
;; flagging it then the adjacency counts can ignore it.
;;
;; In addition to changing the drawing logic, countdown mode also changes how
;; placing flags works, but we'll discuss that when we get there.
;;
;; By default, we'll start in countdown mode, becaues it is the one I happen
;; to prefer :D

(var countdown-mode? true)

;; The first step in drawing is deciding, for each cell in the grid, which tile
;; to use to represent it. Each cell can be in one of four states:
;;
;;    :covered -> a blank, covered tile
;;    :flags -> a covered tile that has been marked with a flag
;;    :? -> a covered tile that has been marked with a question mark
;;    :uncovered -> a tile the player has clicked to reveal what is beneath it

;; Drawing a covered cell is simple. The only interesting behavior is that we
;; draw a different tile while the game is in progress if the mouse is hovering
;; over the cell, to create a sense of interactivity.
(fn tile-for-covered-cell [hovering?]
   (if (and hovering? (not (game-over?))) :covered-hover
      :else :covered))

;; For the flag there are two decisions to make. If the player has flagged a
;; cell they are stating a belief that there is a bomb at that location.
;; Therefore the game will not let the player click the cell to reveal it, as
;; they would lose the game. However, we want to create a sense of interactivity
;; â€”the feeling that the mouse click has been registeredâ€”so we change the cell
;; to a normal :covered tile while the is being clicked.
;;
;; In addition, when the game is in countdown mode flags are special, as they
;; decrease the adjacent counts. To emphasise that the flags are important in
;; this mode, a different tile is drawn for them.

(fn tile-for-flagged-cell [clicking?]
   (if (and clicking? (not (game-over?))) :covered
      countdown-mode? :flag-countdown
      :else :flag))

;; Similar to flags, the player isn't allowed to directly reveal a :? cell. To
;; preserve a sense of interactivity render a clicked on :? as :covered. Like
;; with flags, when the game is over, we don't want to create the impression
;; that cells can be clicked so they don't react to clicking.
(fn tile-for-question-cell [clicking?]
   (if (and clicking? (not (game-over?))) :covered

;; Deciding what tile to draw for uncovered cells is more difficult as it
;; depends on the number of adjacent bombs. If there are no adjacent bombs
;; then the :empty tile will be drawn. Otherwise a tile with the appropriate
;; number should be drawn.
;;
;; Later when we get to updating the game state there will be other pieces of
;; code that need to do similar operations on the set of cells that are adjacent
;; to the given cell. Thus we'll create a new iterator, ineighbors, that
;; iterates through a cells neighbors!

;; The main complication of ineighbors is filtering out cells that aren't valid
;; because they're off the grid in one direction or another. The Fennel macro
;; `-?>` is a "thread maybe" macro that only prefroms each subsequent operation
;; if the result of the previous is non-nil.

;; -------------------------------------------------------------
;; -- Above this line is first draft essay, below is no essay --
;; -------------------------------------------------------------

;; Now we're ready to get into the actual gameplay!

;; The main form of gameplay is clicking on a cell to reveal. However, in
;; minesweeper when you reveal a cell there is a chance that it'll cause many
;; surrounding neighbor cells to also reveal themselves.
;;
;; Specifically, if you reveal a cell and it has no adjacent bombs, then it is
;; trivial to know that all surrounding eight cells are safe to reveal as well.
;; So the game goes ahead and does this for you. This isn't just to save the
;; player the annoyence of revealing cells that they don't have to think about
;; to know are safe, it is also a nice effect that can drastically alter how the
;; board looks, which is a nice gameplay hook.
;;
;; We'll call this a "flood uncover". It is important to know that any uncover
;; action has the potential to be a flood uncover, so we need to run this
;; algorithm each time the player clicks a cell.
;;
;; The algorithm is a basic breadth first search starting with the coordinate
;; that the player clicked. If the surrounding count is 0, then each covered
;; neighbor is added to the queue and the process repeats. In this way the
;; uncover action "floods outwards" until it runs into a "border" where each
;; cell in the border has an adjacent bomb count greater than 0.
;;
;; One other caveat to note is that cells marked with a flag will never be
;; uncovered automatically. In non-countdown mode a flag next to an uncovered
;; cell would be an obvious player error, but in countdown mode where the 0
;; adjacent count means "no more unaccounted for bombs", revaling a flagged cell
;; could cause the player to lose the game! If you're wondering "wait, does that
;; mean we need to flood uncover when a cell is marked with a flag too?", Yes!
;; We'll get there soon.

(fn flood-uncover [x y]
   (local stack [[x y]])
   (while (> (length stack) 0)
      (let [[x y] (table.remove stack)]
         (set-grid x y :state :uncovered)
         (when (= (surrounding-bombs x y) 0)
            (each [nx ny cell (ineighbors x y)]
               (when (or (= cell.state :covered) (= cell.state :?))
                  (table.insert stack [nx ny])))))))

;; With flood-uncover in hand, we can implement the full uncover-cell action
;; that we'll bind to left-click. We won't uncover a flag cell to prevent
;; misclicks from causing the player to lose.
;;
;; The only thing here is that, if the player clicked a bomb cell, we don't do
;; the flood unfill. The only impact here is how the grid looks when it is
;; frozen on the lose screen: only the bomb will be revealed, not any adjacent
;; empty cells.

(fn uncover-cell! []
   (let [cell (selected-cell)]
      (if (~= cell.state :flag)
         (if cell.bomb
            (set cell.state :uncovered)
            :else
            (flood-uncover selected-x selected-y)))))

;; If you recall from earlier, the initial left click is a special case: there
;; are no bombs, we need to place them _after_ the initial cell is uncovered.
;; Here is a modification of the above for this case: move the game from :init
;; state to :play state, place the random bombs, then flood uncover the
;; initially selected cell.

(fn uncover-initial-cell! []
   (set game-state :play)
   (place-bombs! selected-x selected-y)
   (flood-uncover selected-x selected-y))

;; Above I alluded to the fact that, when a cell has no adjacent bombs, all of
;; its neighbors are trivially safe to reveal without any interesting thought on
;; the part of the player required. Uncovering a cell can reveal a that it has
;; no adjacent bombs, and thus trigger a flood uncover.
;;
;; However, in countdown mode, _placing a flag_ causes all neighboring cells to
;; have their adjacent bomb count decrease by 1, potentially to zero! Thus it
;; creates a state where we might need to flood uncover more cells! In this way
;; placing a flag in countdown-mode is actually a risky action, just like
;; uncovering a cell is. If you flag the wrong cell, you might cause the flood
;; unfill to reveal a bomb! This is why I've highlighted flags yellow in
;; countdown mode.
;;
;; The algorithm to make this happen is simple: when the player flags a cells,
;; look at each neighbor of the new flag, as this is the set of cells whose
;; adjacent bomb count will have changed. For each of them with a new adjacent
;; bomb count of zero, initiate a flood-uncover starting at that cell.

(fn flood-uncover-flag [x y]
   "Marking a flag in countdown mode causes adjacent spaces that now show
    a count of 0 to have their neighbors revealed. This could cause the
    a bomb to be revealed and the player to lose the game if a flag location
    is placed incorrectly."
   (each [nx ny cell (ineighbors x y)]
      (when (and (= cell.state :uncovered)
                 (= (surrounding-bombs nx ny) 0))
         (flood-uncover nx ny))))

;; Now we can talk about the final action we'll be binding to mouse clicks:
;; marking cells. There are three ways a cell can be marked: :covered (unmarked),
;; :flag, and :?. Right clicking on a cell cycles through these three states.
;; This map encodes those transitions: if you're :covered, move to :flag. If
;; you're :flag, move to :?, and so on.

(local covered-cell-transitions {
   :covered :flag
   :flag :?
   :? :covered
})

;; And the action itself. Get the next mark state and transition the cell in
;; question to it. And, if we're in countdown mode and just marked a cell as a
;; flag, run the flood-uncover-flag routine from above.

(fn mark-cell! []
   (let [cell (selected-cell)
         next (. covered-cell-transitions cell.state)]
      (set-grid selected-x selected-y :state next)
      (when (and countdown-mode? (= next :flag))
         (flood-uncover-flag selected-x selected-y))))

;; With those three actions implemented, there is only one more thing we need to
;; handle mouse interactions: detecting if the game is over. If the player has

;; cell without a bomb, they have won.

;; ----------
;; To help determine if either of these conditions has been met we'll build a
;; few helper functions. This one takes a predicate function that, when given

   (and (not cell.bomb) (= cell.state :covered)))

;; game-over? simply combines the above helpers: if there are any uncovered
;; bombs the player has lost. If there are no more covered empty cells, they've
;; won.
;;
;; Of note: this function returns multiple values. If the game is over it

;; And now, finally, we can combine all of the above to handle the majority of
